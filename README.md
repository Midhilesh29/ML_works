## IrisPrediction
Developed Machine Learning models for Iris dataset namely **Logistic Regression**,**KNN Classifier**,**SVM**,**Decision Tree**.

## LinearRegression
Built linear regression model from scratch for a predicting average weight of body using average weight of body for mammalian species with **r square value 0.94**

## LoanPrediction
Predicting whether loan can be given or not with some qualifications using machine learning models, **missing values were populated using KNN Classifier and using mode**.

## mnist_code ##
